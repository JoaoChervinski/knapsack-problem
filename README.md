# Knapsack Problem
The Knapsack Problem is an optimization problem. Given a set of items each with a pair of values representing weight and value of the item, the algorithm must determine the maximum possible value for the knapsack such that the combined weight of the items in the knapsack does not exceed it's capacity.
